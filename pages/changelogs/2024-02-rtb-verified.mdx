As part of my drive for Rental Transparency in Ireland, I mapped all the properties registered with the RTB: https://www.howmuchrent.com/r/rtb_verified . It cost me over 1000 Euro to do this, and I hope you find it useful. This gives the first insight into where people are registered to rent.

Every Renter has a story to tell about their place. Add your story to HowMuchRent.com. Read reviews tenants left of their place, and past prices charged for properties.

From https://www.rtb.ie/registration-and-compliance/registrations/registering-your-tenancy/how-to-register

Taking effect from 04 April 2022, a landlord is obliged to apply to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to register a tenancy - or a licence in Student Specific Accommodation (SSA) - within 1 month of its commencement date and every year after this, on the anniversary of the date the tenancy began, for so long as the tenancy/SSA licence exists.â€¯
