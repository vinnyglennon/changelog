[https://www.howmuchrent.com/r/rtb_reports](https://www.howmuchrent.com/r/rtb_reports) now has over 15k Residential Tenancies Board judgements available to explore. When you are viewing a property, you can now tell if the landlord/tenant ever went to court in dispute, for example over the Landlord not returning the deposit. 

These reports are available on [https://www.rtb.ie](https://www.rtb.ie), but only in PDF format. There was no map showing their location and were not searchable.

[https://www.howmuchrent.com/r/rtb_reports](https://www.howmuchrent.com/r/rtb_reports) to see all the reports. Some landlords have over 100 reports against them. I have spotted tenants with multiple cases against them too from different landlords. 

HowMuchRent.com eliminates the guesswork from the renting process in Ireland. It's time for clarity.
