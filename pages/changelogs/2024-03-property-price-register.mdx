We have mapped out all the properties listed in the registered that have a valid eircode, so that you compare the purchase costs of houses when you see the rental charge being asked for.

The Residential Property Price Register contains sale prices of residential properties sold in Ireland since January 1, 2010. It's a useful resource for individuals looking to rent because it provides a historical record of sale prices by address, county, and date, offering insights into the property market trends and price movements in different areas. This information can help renters estimate current market rates, understand property value trends, and make informed decisions when considering rental properties in specific locations. For detailed information and searches, you can visit the source material at: [Property Price Register](https://www.propertypriceregister.ie/website/npsra/pprweb.nsf/PPR?OpenForm).
