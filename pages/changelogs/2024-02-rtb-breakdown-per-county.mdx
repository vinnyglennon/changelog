As part of my drive for Rental Transparency in Ireland, last week I mapped over 250k properties registered with the RTB.
Over the weekend, i looked into some of the stats.


[Ireland](https://www.howmuchrent.com/pages/rtb_graphs?county=Republic%20Of%20Ireland)

[Dublin](https://www.howmuchrent.com/pages/rtb_graphs?county=Dublin) 

[Galway](https://www.howmuchrent.com/pages/rtb_graphs?county=Galway)


[Cork](https://www.howmuchrent.com/pages/rtb_graphs?county=Cork)

The rest of the counties are listed there too.

[Kildare has more rental property(registered with the RTB)](https://www.howmuchrent.com/pages/rtb_graphs?county=Republic%20Of%20Ireland) than Limerick which is a surprise to me. 

The top 3 eircodes registered for renting are in Galway, Cork and then Dublin 8, amazingly. On a city level, Dublin dwarfs all others nationwide, as expected, and Cork has nearly twice as many registered to rent in its country as Galway. 

People are reporting new Estates that have already been rented out. 

We can now track the number of registered properties month on month, to see which areas are increasing/decreasing.
